<h1>Speech Services for Enterprise</h1>
<h2>What is enterprise requirements?</h2>
For enterprise customers, the following functionality need available.
<i><ul>
  <li>Private Network Access</li>
  <li>Access Control</li>
  <li>Data Encryption</li>
  <li>Audit</li>
</ul></i>

As Speech Services consists of several services, need to prioritize documentation.

<i><ul>
  <li>Batch transcription</li>
  <li>Realtime transcription</li>
  <li>Conversation transcription</li>
  <li>Text to speech</li>
  <li>Speech translation</li>
  <li>Speaker Recognition</li>
  and so on...
</ul></i>

We start documentation from [Batch Transcription](BatchTranscription\BatchTranscription.md) as it includes several resources to function.
